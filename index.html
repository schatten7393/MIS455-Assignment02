            <p>Uchiha Madara was the legendary leader of the Uchiha clan. Madara and his siblings grew up on the
                battlefield waging constant war with the Uchiha's rivals</p>
            <p>After his return from death and various enhancements, Madara was able to decisively defeat thousands of
                shinobi,
                the Five Kage, and the nine tailed beasts, all at once respectively.Madara was also confident if he had
                senjutsu
                chakra, he would have been able to defeat Obito while the latter was the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki. </p>
                <p>
                    Madara's years of experience on the battlefield honed his strategic ingenuity. He could quickly devise a number of approaches and could switch approaches immediately. The longer he spent against a particular opponent, the less he needed backup tactics, as he could eventually predict what they would do and identify literal or psychological weaknesses to exploit. He could form and verify any theories he comes up with using small details.
                </p>
                <p>Madara was 90 at his death </p>

            </h3>
            <p>Madara was one of the most powerful shinobi in history, recognised as the strongest Uchiha in his
                lifetime
                and for decades after his death.He was born with very powerful chakra and incredibly skilled in
                taijutsu, ninjutsu, bukijutsu, dōjutsu.
                His large chakra reserves allowed him to fight nonstop for twenty-four hours before collapsing and in
                his
                old age, summon the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path from its cage in the moon.His chakra control could
                perform complicated techniques with a single hand seal. He could also quickly absorb and synchronise
                senjutsu chakra with his own and therefore enter Sage Mode, despite having no prior training in
                senjutsu.
